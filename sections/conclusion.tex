\section{Conclusi√≥n.}

After this analysis we discover that cubrices conform a truly interesting and mysterious set. Contrary to what one might have thought, this algebra isn't backward compatible with two-dimensional matrices, although it's true that the underlying sets actually are.

We have left out many topics of vital importance which could be of interest to future investigations. Notions like the ``determinant'', the ``range'' or a definition of equality among cubrices which could make them backward compatible with matrices.

We hope that this document encourages the curiosity upon this algebra on the reader.
