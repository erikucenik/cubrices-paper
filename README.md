# Cubrices

A small paper I wrote about extrapolating the concept of "matrices" into the third dimension (cubrices, not to be confused with tensors).

To compile the project, just do `make`. It's written in LaTeX, so `pdflatex` and the respective packages will be required.

Feel free to build upon the concept.

A Python implementation can be found on [this other repo](https://github.com/erikucenik/cubrices).
